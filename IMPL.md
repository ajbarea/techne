# techne — Implementation scratchpad

The active TODO list for whatever's in flight **right now** — current
PR, open design question blocking me, immediate next pickup. Queued
specs, cross-skill themes, and "next up" ordering live in
[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md). Git history is the permanent record of
how each skill was designed.

If this file is more than ~50 lines, something queued or referential
has crept in; extract it back to ROADMAP.

## In flight

### Landed: heuresis phase 2, the gold set

`scripts/heuresis_gold.py run` (or `make heuresis-gold GUARD=<ideas repo>`) triages each case in
`plugins/heuresis/gold/cases.yaml` with this checkout's plugin, in a scratch ideas repository under
`~/.local/state/heuresis-gold`, and `heuresis/gold.py` grades the runs. Each grade records the case
labels and the commit under test; `report` refuses grades whose labels changed, and `regrade`
re-scores kept work folders without reviving a failed run. `RESULTS.md` is the generated summary of
the last full run; regenerate it rather than editing it.

### Then: commit guards on Git 2.54 hooks (#96)

Config-based `commit-msg` and `pre-commit` hooks set through `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`. Git 2.54 has shipped
(2.56 is current), but WSL's Ubuntu 24.04 has 2.43; testing needs a 2.54 or newer git here.

## Skill collection state

Shipped plugins and skills by catalog dimension (the directory listing of `plugins/*/skills/` is the source of truth):
