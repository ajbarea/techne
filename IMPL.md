# techne — Implementation scratchpad

The active TODO list for whatever's in flight **right now** — current
PR, open design question blocking me, immediate next pickup. Queued
specs, cross-skill themes, and "next up" ordering live in
[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md). Git history is the permanent record of
how each skill was designed.

If this file is more than ~50 lines, something queued or referential
has crept in — extract it back to ROADMAP.

## In flight

Nothing in flight. Opt-in guard hooks shipped in #95 (see ROADMAP).

**Next pickup:** #96, backing the commit guards with Git 2.54 config-based `commit-msg` and
`pre-commit` hooks set through `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`, so commits the Bash parser cannot see are
still checked. Blocked on Git 2.54 being available to test against.

## Skill collection state

Shipped skills by catalog dimension (the directory listing of `plugins/techne/skills/` is the source of truth):

| Dimension | Skills |
| --- | --- |
| **Audit** | `audit`, `ci-audit` |
| **Drift** | `docsync`, `docs-site`, `research-grounded`, `sisters` |
| **Hygiene** | `auto-commit`, `deslop`, `reslop` |
| **Review** | `catchup`, `elenchus` |
| **Observation** | `theoros` |
| **Document build** | `latex`, `pdf`, `paper`, `paper-review`, `slides` |

When picking up the next session, replace the "In flight" block above
with a full session plan (Why / Decisions / Scope / Out of scope /
Definition of done) following the same template every other sister
uses.
